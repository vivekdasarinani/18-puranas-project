 <p>  Puranas
================
 All 18 Maha Puranas(English): Vishnu,
 Naradiya, Padma, Garuda, Varaha, Bhagavata, Matsya, Kurma, Linga, Shiva, 
Skanda, Agni, Brahmanda, Brahmavaivarta, 
Markandeya, Bhavishya, Vamana, Brahma


There is 1 Maha Purana, 18 Mukhya Puranas (Major Puranas) and 18 Upa Puranas
 (Minor Puranas)

with over 400,000 verses

They have been influential in the Hindu culture, inspiring major national and regional annual festivals of Hinduism. Their role and value as sectarian religious texts and historical texts has been controversial because all Puranas praise many gods and goddesses and "their sectarianism is far less clear cut" than assumed, states Ludo Rocher.[12] The religious practices included in them are considered Vaidika (congruent with Vedic literature), because they do not preach initiation into Tantra.[13] The Bhagavata Purana has been among the most celebrated and popular text in the Puranic genre, and is, in the opinion of some, of non-dualistic tenor.[14][15] But, the dualistic school of Shriman Madhvacharya has a rich and strong tradition of dualistic interpretation of the Bhagavata, starting from the Bhagavata Taatparya Nirnaya of the Acharya himself and later, commentaries on the commentary. The Chaitanya school also rejects outright any monistic interpretation of the purana. The Puranic literature wove with the Bhakti movement in India, and both Dvaita and Advaita scholars have commented on the underlying Vedantic themes in the Maha Puranas.

 
 <br>

1	Brahma	10,000 verses	Sometimes also called Adi Purana, because many Mahapuranas 
       lists put it first of 18.[33] The text has 245 chapters, shares many passages with Vishnu, 
       Vayu, Markendeya Puranas, and with the Mahabharata. Includes mythology, theory of war, 
     art work in temples, and other cultural topics. Describes holy places in Odisha, and weaves

            The Shiva Purana asserts that it once consisted of 100,000 verses set out in twelve samhitas (books),

"Future Purana") is one of the eighteen major works in the Purana genre of Hinduism, written in Sanskrit.The title Bhavishya means "future" and implies it is a work that contains prophecies regarding the future, however, the "prophecy" parts of the extant manuscripts are a modern era addition and hence not an integral part of the Bhavishya Purana.Those sections of the surviving manuscripts that are dated to be older, are partly borrowed from other Indian texts such as Brihat Samhita and Shamba Purana.

  <p>The hook is a powerful punch with knockout power.<br>When throwing a hook, the puncher shifts his body weight to the lead foot, allowing him to pivot his lead foot and generate kinetic energy through the hip/torso/shoulder, swinging his lead fist horizontally toward the opponent. Sometimes, depending on style and what feels comfortable to the individual, the lead foot is not pivoted. Pivoting increases the power of the punch, but leaves one lacking in options to follow up with, such as the right uppercut or right hook. </p>

   	  <p> All the Puranas are related to the class of Suhrit-Sammitas or the Friendly Treatises. The Puranas belong to the class of Itihasas (the Ramayana and the Mahabharata).

The Puranas endeavor to bring people closer to the Gods.

It should be appreciated that the Puranas tell the Supreme Truth to one and all in a very simple manner.
<br>

All the Puranas are dedicated to certain deities.
<br>

Some are dedicated to Gods, and others are dedicated to Goddesses. They contain the essence of spiritual teachings and complex yogic philosophies of the ancient Vedic texts.
<br>

Puranas are the most important religious texts in the Bhakti Yoga tradition. They go on to emphasize the devotional aspect of Yoga. They cultivate devotion by using a personification of the chosen deities in the form of entertaining myths and stories.
<br>

For example, the Bhagavata Purana describes Bhakti Yoga and all the steps of its practices.
<br>

In the Linga Purana, you get a description of Yama (disciplines), Niyama (virtues), and Pranayama (breathing techniques).
<br>

Another text, the Vayu Purana covers information about Pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), Dharana (concentration) and Dhyana (meditation).
<br>

The Puranas go on to express the growth of Hindu Dharma, the condition of society in ancient times, social customs, religious ceremonies, as well as yogic methods of discipline.

All in all, Puranas endeavor to re-establish the eternal relation of living beings with God. They have been created so that any class of men (or women) can take advantage of them and experience the compassion and greatness of God.</p>
